-Working in an ER, I encountered this all the time. I remember a specific time where I had multiple, 
 low trauma patients whose charts I needed to complete, when all of a sudden we had three trauma patients come in.
 I knew that there would be no way that I would be able to complete my other charts while also taking down all the new information for these 
 new patients, soI  decided to quickly write the discharge papers 
 for my current patients,
 and proceeded to start working on the new patients. When things had finally stabalized, 
 I was able to go back into my previous charts, and fill them out to completion.
